I am a research assistant at [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/data-science-und-ihre-anwendungen/mitarbeiter-dsa/). I am conducting my research under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Vollmer](https://sebastian.vollmer.ms/) and [Prof. Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com/), studying the Representation Learning for Remote Sensing data. Previously, I was a research intern at [Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I hold two M.Sc. degrees in Mathematical Sciences and Machine Intelligence from AIMS Cameroon and [AIMS Rwanda](https://aimsammi.org/) respectively (2017-2019) and a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Khartoum, Sudan.

My research interest include deeplearning, representatin lerning, robustness, fairness and interpretability. I am also broadly interested in unsupervised representation learning for different modalities (text, vision) and finding good disentangled representations which are generally important for good performance on some downstream tasks.

In other news, I am very passionate about ML community, teaching, learning and research. I enjoy running and traveling.
